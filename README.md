# Classification of Brain Functional Region through DTW and QT on EEG

This project was created by Yohan Wei as part of the coursework for 24 Fall Networks and Complexity at Tongji University, Shanghai.
This is a basic trial for classifying brain regions based on their functional roles in the process of watching videos. 

The chosen dataset for testing the programme is DEAP, which can be obtain from _http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/_. 
The similarity of different channels is calculated using dynamic time warping (DTW), which takes time lag into consideration.
The Quality Threshold is used to classify the channels into different categories.
I would like to thank the MNE package and the DEAP dataset, which were invaluable in the development of this project.

This project is not without flaws. Should you have any suggestions for improvement, I would be grateful if you could send an email to _2353242@tongji.edu.cn_ to inform me.
